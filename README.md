## API Reference

- The app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather data. You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to run the app.
- Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
- Update the `apiKey` variable in `script.js` with your API key.

  ```javascript
  const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here'; // Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
  ```

Hereâ€™s how you can describe the two API calls in the README, along with an explanation of the JSON responses you receive from each.
